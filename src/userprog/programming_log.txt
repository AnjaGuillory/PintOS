So far what was done:
An argument list was declared inside of thread struct that holds a list of argument structures. These argument structures hold a list element and the actual argument string. While parsing the command line, we declare an argument struct for each argument and initialize these char arguments to the tokens that are parsed. We are trying to print these out, however this is where we are stuck. 

After speaking with Jon, we are overcomplicating things. Instead of doing EVERYTHING in setup_stack() such as setting up the stack arguments and pushing them in. We can just create a new function to do exactly this and call it IN setup_stack().

This way, we can make a new function that also takes file_name, and esp, parses file_name, and for each token just push it on to the stack. This way we do not have to book keep every argument! We just have to take into account the order somehow. But we can figure this out later!


UPDATED!

The argument struct, arguments list and arg_elem in threads are deleted.
Now, a new function called the_stack(file_name,esp) is created. Here we set up the program stack by incrementing and decrementing esp, as well as a temporary register in order to copy the parsed tokens onto the stack, and then copy the addresses of the arguments appropriately and orderly. Before this procedure, we parse the command line in this function also. 

Currently, we do not have any recordings of what the stack pointer and arguments statuses are. 

LATEST UPDATE
 
 Added a list of children (as well as child list element) to bookkeep each threads' children. Also, in thread_create, we added a push to this list the child that the current process is creating. In thread_init, we initialize the parent thread's list of children. This was created so that upon waiting for a child, we can access the child's information to wait for by identifying it by the tid that is passed into the wait method.


 For exit (and wait), implement a marker to tell if a child's parent is waiting or not in order to send an exit status to a parent or just the kernel. 

UPDATE:

We added create and open. The currently added function return values are put into EAX in the switch cases. 
Create causes some compiling errors. Open just gets the name of the file and creates a file struct. It 
checks to see if the file struct is null (so error if so), otherwise returns 0. We need to figure out how to 
implement a file descriptor that does not use the reserved 0 and 1 for console.
